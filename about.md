**Rubynilia**

I've been learning to program in Ruby and developing web applications since late 2015. This blog journals some of the things I've learned along the way that I'd like to share with others on the journey.

Here's what I've been working on so far!

[Whats Good](https://github.com/davdkm/whats-good) - A simple app that rates posts. Post content and rating other people's posts. Front end built with AngularJS and back end Rails serving JSON.

[Wat Do](http://wat-do-app.herokuapp.com/) [github](https://github.com/davdkm/wat-do) - A Rails app that helps manage events. Bulit in Rails 4 and JQuery, and github Omniauth

[Aks Me](https://github.com/davdkm/aks-me) - A question and answer site built with Sinatra.
